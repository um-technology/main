        <p><h1><span class="big-letter">Magnesium-based materials show great potential for producing biodegradable stents, but their high corrosion rates are a roadblock.
        This study investigates whether ultrasound melt treatment can change the corrosion response of an extruded AZ91D-1.0%Ca (wt.%) in Earle's Balanced Salt Solution by 
        tailoring the intermetallics' morphology in the as-extruded state. The results showed that the wires from ultrasound-treated ingots corroded faster than non-treated 
        ones in immersion for up to 6 hours. This trend shifted for longer periods, and ultrasound-treated material showed lower corrosion rates and uniform corrosion, while 
        the non-treated material displayed localized corrosion signs. Tensile testing of the wires demonstrated that immersion in EBSS lowered the tensile strength and 
        elongation at fracture due to material degradation, regardless of the processing route. Nonetheless, this decline was sharper in the non-treated material.These findings 
        suggest that ultrasound melt processing can be a promising method for improving the corrosion resistance of magnesium-based materials, paving the way for their use in 
        manufacturing biodegradable stents.</span></h1><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213956723001664?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Link: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jma.2023.07.013</a></p>

        <p><h1><span class="big-letter">Metallic cellular solids are a class of materials known for their high specific mechanical properties, being desirable in applications
        where a combination of high strength or stiffness and low density are important. These lightweight materials are often stochastic and manufactured by foaming or casting. 
        If regular (periodic) lattice structures are desired, they may be manufactured by metallic additive manufacturing techniques. However, these have characteristic issues, 
        such as un-melted powders, porosity and heterogeneous microstructures. This study reports a novel low-cost route for producing regular lattice structures by an additive
        manufacturing assisted investment casting technique. Fused filament fabrication is used to produce the lattice structure pattern which is infiltrated with plaster. The 
        pattern is then burnt off and the aluminum is cast in vacuum. In this way we can manufacture non-stochastic metallic lattices having fine struts/ribs (0.6 mm cross-section 
        using a 0.4 mm nozzle) and relative densities down to 0.036. X-ray micro computed tomography (μCT) showed that as-cast A356 Aluminium alloy frameworks have high dimensional 
        tolerances and fine detail control. Frameworks based on units of six connected struts ranging from intruding (auxetic) to protruding (hexagonal) strut angles are studied.
        Vertical struts are finer than expected, reducing their moment of area which could impact their compressive strength. This new, low cost, route for producing high precision 
        metallic cellular lattices offers an attractive alternative to other additive manufacturing techniques (e.g. selective laser and electron beam melting).</span></h1><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221486041932264X?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Link: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addma.2020.101085</a></p>

        <p><h1><span class="big-letter">Simulations of manufacturing processes typically rely on commercial or publicly available material databases. In the casting process,
        additives such as grain refiners and eutectic Si modifiers can affect the properties of molten metal during solidification. However, these effects are not always 
        represented in the material’s thermophysical characteristics. This study differentiates the simulated filling and defect indicators of a aluminium alloy from different 
        material databases. Further, to account the effect of the grain refiner, thermal analysis data from a Al-7Si-Mg alloy with 0.2 wt.% Al-5Ti-B is used to create a 
        corrected alloy that minimises the difference between numerical and experimental results. Results indicate that minor differences in thermophysical properties can
        affect misrun risk and filling temperatures. The corrected alloy more accurately represents heat release during phase transformation and reduces the temperature
        error from 7°C to 4°C. Additionally, it more accurately represents shrinkage, with the exception of some localised defects.</span></h1><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addma.2020.101085" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Link: https://doi.org/10.1080/13640461.2023.2237651</a></p>
